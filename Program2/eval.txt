/* Evaluation Procedure:

    - Try to stay depth + 1 tiles away from ghosts.
    	find bfspath to both ghosts
	    if (ghosts are closer than safe dist):
	    	find the closest big pellet as possible 
	    	take path that increases dist from ghosts the most (blinky, THEN inky)

	    else:
			set path to the closest pellets available

    Blinky: Follows Pacman

    Inky: goes for opposite side of pacman as blinky
    TODO:
    	- Find pacmans location
    	- Find pacman's direction
    	- aim for the tile n (depth) steps ahead of pacman
